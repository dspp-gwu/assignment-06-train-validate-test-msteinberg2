    "# Putting some rigor in traditional statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Statisticians have long been aware of the problem of over-fitting. When a researcher runs a regression, they typically do so because they want to explore or test a hypothesis about how the world works beyond the data they have at hand.  They are trying to make a finding that *generalizes*. Overfitting is a term that is used to describe cases where a researcher develops a model that fits the data they have very well, but does not generalize to other data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over-fitting can happen in many ways, and the disciplines of traditional statistics and machine learning have developed related methods for dealing with the problem. This week, we are looking at some of the methods that were developed in statistics to address the issue, methods that were further systematized in the field of machine learning. "

    "\n",
    "The first thing you need to know is that reliable findings -- findings that generalize -- typically require a lot of data.  The fewer data you have, the greater the risk of non-representation.  Further, the fewer data you have, the easier it is to explain all the statistical variation in the data with a few variables. There are a few rules of thumb about the size of your dataset, but one is that for any number of parameters (variables in your model), you should have at least somewhere between 10x and 50x that number in each of your subsets of data (train, validate, and test).  That typically means an N of at least 50x the number of parameters in your model. So if you have 10 parameters, you should have 500 or more rows of data. \n"

    "The training set, which typically has 60% of the data, is safe for the statistician to explore using any techniques they like. Data mining is allowed and even encouraged.  Why? Becuase any model that is built on the training data will have to be validated on the second set.

Let's assume for now that we're working towards a version of PredPol -- the predictive polcing model that we've seen criticized in our readings.  Seeing how these models are developed is useful so that we can give a more sophisticated evaluation of them. Eventually, we'll definitely want to look at it as a time series, and that will give us plenty of data, but we're not quite ready to develop our own super-sophisticated model just yet.  For now, we'll just be running regressions on yearly aggregates from 2010, and that will limit our number of observatios.  Time series, and the problem of how to manage all the data associated with time will come later; the moral and policy problems associated with predicting crime are already up for discussion, but will beome more pointed as the weeks go on.\n",

    "As with many historic ills, crime is concentrated in historically disadvantaged communities subject to extended implicit and explicit discrimination.  It is impossible to have a responsible discussion about crime without also talking about the history of redlining, urban neglect by both the private and public sectors (including policing), and the role explicit and implicit bias in driving disproportionate portions of Black and Latino residents into jail.  But what does this mean for us when building a model predicting crime?  If we include race and ethnicity in our model, are we saying -- or letting others infer -- that there is something inherent in the residents those labels describe that is intrinsically more criminal?  Or is it ok to use race and ethnicity as stand-ins for historic discrimination and disadvantage?  There is no simple answer. For this exercise, I'm going to avoid using race and ethnicity as proxies, and try to find other measures of disadvantage.  This will cost me some predictive power, but in the long-run, I think it will make people who use the model less likely to make the kind of improper inferences that can drive bad policy.  "

We can probably only afford to have a few parameters in our final model.  So let's do what good statisticians did for a while.

There is a story about people living in low-income high-crime neighborhoods that pays little attention to how poverty, crime, and a dysfunctional criminal justice system can, over decades, pull families and communities apart. Thankfully, a lot of research has turned that story around, and most policy makers are interested in working on reducing improper policing and incarceration rates.

In fancier versions of data mining, we could have it tell us how to drop to successively smaller sets of parameters while preserving the greatest fit.   But we're going to move way beyond this kind of methodology soon, but the approach contains some ideas that we'll be using later. We try to build a model that fits the training data and see if it is robust enough to survive exposure to new data.  \n",

    "There are a few things that tell me that this is overfitted.  First, if we have four measures of the same thing (income, wealth, poverty), we're going to have a problem in that the specific combination of them is probably highly collinear and likely to cause overfitting. In a more advanced setting, we'd try some version of what is called \"dimensionality reduction\" that reduces the number of parameters using \"principal compenents\" or \"factors\" or \"clusters\".  All of them find some way of combining (and thus reducing the number of) the parameters involved.  \n",
